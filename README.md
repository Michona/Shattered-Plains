# Overview

**Turn-based tactical PVP game** played on a board (square grid). The player controls 3 characters with distinct move/attack patterns and abilities. You can move and attack once per character in your turn. There is a timer on the turn, so it is more fast paced. Each character class has one ability that is once per game. The board has random generated “obstacles” in some tiles, that pervert movement and projectiles.
